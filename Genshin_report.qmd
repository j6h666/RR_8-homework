## Genshin Impact

Genshin Impact is an action role-playing game developed by miHoYo, published by miHoYo in mainland China and worldwide by Cognosphere,  HoYoverse. It was released for Android, iOS, PlayStation 4, and Windows in 2020, and on PlayStation 5 in 2021. The game features an anime-style open-world environment and an action-based battle system using elemental magic and character-switching. A free-to-play game monetized through gacha game mechanics, Genshin Impact is expanded regularly through patches using the games as a service model.

Genshin Impact takes place in the fantasy world of Teyvat, home to seven nations, each of which is tied to a different element and ruled by a different god (archon). The story follows The Traveler, an interstellar adventurer who, at the start of the game, is separated from their twin sibling after the two land in Teyvat. Thereafter, the Traveler journeys across the nations of Teyvat in search of the lost sibling, accompanied by their guide, Paimon. Along the way, the two befriend myriad individuals, become involved in the affairs of its nations, and begin to unravel the mysteries of the land.

## GamePlay

Genshin Impact is an open-world, action role-playing game that allows the player to control one of four interchangeable characters in a party.[4] Switching between characters can be done quickly during combat, allowing the player to use several different combinations of skills and attacks.[5] Characters may have their abilities enhanced in various ways, mainly through directly leveling them up and improving the artifacts and weapons that a character can equip.[6] In addition to exploration, the player can attempt various challenges for rewards. Scattered across Teyvat are bosses and challenges that reward highly valuable resources, but claiming them uses up a currency called Original Resin, which slowly regenerates over time.[7] Completing these challenges grants the player progress towards increasing their Adventure Rank, which in turn unlocks new quests, challenges, and raises the World Level.[8] The World Level is a measure of how strong the enemies within the world are and the rarity of rewards that defeating them gives.

## Basic Sales on character

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
cha <- read.csv('D:\\DSBA\\Dissertation MA\\genshin full description data\\genshin_character_revenue_history.csv')
ggplot(data = cha, aes(x = Banner, y = Sum_final)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "skyblue") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1, vjust = 0.5)) +
  labs(title = "Sum Sales by Banner",
       x = "Banner",
       y = "Sum of Final Values")

```

According to the sales graph, we may observe that the highest revenue was generated by character named Raiden Shogun and lowest generated by Lyney.

Next, we will be looking for some popular characters based on the ratings given by players

```{python}
import pandas as pd
import os
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
who_works=1
if who_works==1:
    os.chdir("D:\\DSBA\\Dissertation MA\\genshin full description data")
else:
  print('no such directory found')
genshin = pd.read_csv('GS_final_rank.csv')
model_cluster = KMeans(n_clusters=3,random_state=40)
model_cluster.fit(genshin['ranks'].values.reshape(-1,1))
center = model_cluster.cluster_centers_
labels = model_cluster.labels_
print(center)
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
colors = ['red', 'green', 'blue']  # Colors for the clusters
X = genshin['ranks'].values.reshape(-1,1)
# Scatter plot of the data points colored by their cluster label
for i in range(3):
    plt.scatter(X[labels == i], np.zeros_like(X[labels == i]) + 0.01*i, color=colors[i], label=f'Cluster {i+1}', edgecolor='k')

# Scatter plot for the cluster centers
plt.scatter(center, np.zeros_like(center), s=300, color='yellow', label='Centers', marker='*')

plt.title('Cluster Visualization of Genshin Ranks')
plt.xlabel('Ranks')
plt.yticks([])  # Hide y axis as it's not informative in this 1D plot
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

We observe that three clusters are generated. Where the cluster with highest ranking (most popular characters) is with centroid around 7, median ranking around 6 (intermediate popular characters) and low ranking (low popular characters) around 4.
